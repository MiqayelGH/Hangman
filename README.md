# About 

Welcome to the classic game of Hangman!

In this game, your goal is to guess all the letters of a randomly selected word. But be careful! You only have 7 chances to guess a wrong letter, otherwise you lose the game.

To play, simply input your guess for each letter one at a time. If you guess correctly, the letter will be revealed in the word. If you guess incorrectly, you will lose a guess. You can continue guessing until you either guess all the letters in the word or run out of guesses.

Are you ready to test your vocabulary and guessing skills? Let's play Hangman!
